# hyades-csaf

This repo tracks integration of CSAF into DependencyTrack (Hyades). Since hyades is a micro-services architecture, the development of the various components is spread into multiple git submodules, which track the official DependencyTrack repo. Each repository has a branch `csaf` that contains the adaption of CSAF into hyades.
